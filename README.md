# Algorithm Effecincy
Project was created in my Data Structures and Algorithms class.  
Project was done with the help of Ethan Nix and Krutivas Pradhan.  

countSort.cpp contains the count sort algorithm.  
testProject.cpp stress tests count sort and records the data in a csv file.  
Two csv files are used due to a previous error.  
Analyze.R generates graphs of the data which can be found in the Graphs directory.
